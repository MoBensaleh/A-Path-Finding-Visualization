# A-Path-Finding-Visualization
A* is a popular pathfinding algorithm that is used to find the shortest path between two points on a grid. It combines the use of a heuristic function with the cost of movement to efficiently search through the grid and find the optimal path. A* is commonly used in computer science and game development to allow objects to navigate around obstacles and find the most efficient path to their destination. Working on this project has allowed me to further my understanding of algorithms and their practical applications, as well as work on my skills in GUI and front end development.
