# A-Path-Finding-Visualization
A* is a popular pathfinding algorithm that is used to find the shortest path between two points on a grid. It combines the use of a heuristic function with the cost of movement to efficiently search through the grid and find the optimal path. A* is commonly used in computer science and game development to allow objects to navigate around obstacles and find the most efficient path to their destination. Working on this project has allowed me to further my understanding of algorithms and their practical applications, as well as work on my skills in GUI and front end development.

## Instructions for Running the Application

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can check if you have Python installed by opening a terminal and typing "python3 --version". If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Next, you will need to install pygame. You can do this by typing "pip3 install pygame" in your terminal.

3. Once you have Python and pygame installed, download the files from the github repository onto your machine.

4. Navigate to the directory where the files are saved using your terminal.

5. Run the program by typing "python3 path_finding.py" in your terminal. The program should now start and you can use it to visualize Dijkstra's algorithm.
